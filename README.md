A front end for my existing writing portfolio at timbeckett-writing.com, built on Wordpress. I considered starting from scratch, but there is too much content on my current site - over 200 posts (albeit many of them carried over from an old blog) to make it worthwhile to start over with a fresh database, admin etc. 

The data will continue to be managed through the WP admin, utilizing the Gutenberg editor (which is ideal for magazine-style layouts). 

I chose Gatsby.js, because I'm interested in learning GraphQL and so much is already built in. And, well, Gatsby.js is the flavour of the moment for SSR (Server-Side-Rendering) for Wordpress. 

I will start small and add more features as I go along. For the moment, my priority is to organize the content in some coherent fashion.
